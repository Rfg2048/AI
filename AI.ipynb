    "According to Cambridge Dictionary a graph is a picture that shows  how two sets of information or variables are related, usually by lines or curves, and a tree diagram shows the relationships between different pieces of information using lines that are connected and have different branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main differences between graph and tree is the structure cycle, while graph can be connnected or disconnected, have cycles or loops and doesn't necessarily have a root node, the tree structure cycle relies on a single root node which is connected and acyclic (graph with no graph cycles).\n",
    "\n",
    "While a graph can havy any number of edges directed or undirected, trees may only have $n$ being nodes, $n-1$ number of edges and they are always directed. Graphs are used normally to model complex systems or relationships, like social networks or computer networks. Trees are used to represent data with hierachy structure, such as dile systems pr organization charts.\n",
